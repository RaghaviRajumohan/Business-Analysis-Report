# Fargo Health: Predictive Analysis of Cardiovascular Examination Demand

This project focuses on addressing operational inefficiencies for Fargo Health, a healthcare provider managing disability compensation examinations across 34 clinics. By utilizing historical data, I developed a predictive model to forecast the demand for cardiovascular examinations, which enables Fargo Health to allocate resources more efficiently and avoid costly outsourcing.

## Technical Skills Applied:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Implemented ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) models to predict future demand trends based on historical examination data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Evaluated and compared various imputation techniques, such as KNN and Interpolation, to fill missing values, and selected the most accurate method for the task.
- **Data Visualization**: Generated clear and insightful visualizations, including trend lines, box plots, and forecast graphs, to better understand data patterns and communicate findings effectively.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like AIC, BIC, RMSE, and MAE to ensure the accuracy and reliability of predictions.
- **Statistical Testing**: Performed stationarity testing using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to validate the underlying assumptions of time-series models.

## Tools Used:
- R
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

This project demonstrates my expertise in data cleaning, time-series forecasting, and applying machine learning techniques to real-world healthcare data.
